A project that uses HTML and Tailwind css to help users to access event planning website.
Event Planner Website

Project Overview
The Event Planner Website is a digital solution designed to simplify event booking for individuals, families, students, and the general public. This platform allows users to easily explore, plan, and book events through a professional and responsive website.

The website includes six main pages:

Home – Hero section, service highlights, call-to-action buttons.
About – Company story, mission, and vision.
Services – Detailed overview of event planning services.
Gallery – Showcase of previous events and decorations.
Blog – Tips and guides on event planning.
Contact – Contact form and company information for inquiries and bookings.

All pages feature a consistent navbar and footer for ease of navigation, and the design is fully responsive using Tailwind CSS.

Problem Statement
During initial research, I consulted 5 students to understand their needs regarding event planning. I discovered that they struggled to find a centralized platform to book events with professional companies like Event Planner.

Upon further consultation with the Event Planner company, I learned that the issue is not limited to students alone — parents, citizens, and the wider public also face similar difficulties in accessing event planning services efficiently.

Research and Consultation

Student Feedback – Interviewed 5 students regarding their experience with booking events. Students reported difficulty in finding a reliable platform to book events and compare services.

Company Consultation – Discussed with Event Planner the challenges they face in reaching potential clients digitally and gathering booking information efficiently.

Public Needs – Recognized that the platform should cater not only to students but also to parents and the general public seeking event planning services.

Solution
To address these challenges, I designed a user-friendly digital platform that enables:

Easy booking of various events including weddings, corporate events, birthdays, and more.
Quick access to service details, gallery of past events, and event planning tips.
Direct contact with the company through a responsive contact form.
Professional and minimal design that is responsive on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

This solution provides a digital bridge between the Event Planner company and potential clients, streamlining the booking process and improving overall accessibility.

Technologies Used
HTML5 – Structure and layout of the website.
Tailwind CSS – Responsive and professional styling.
